/* Easy Wallpaper */

/*
John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

Task: 
Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

Example:
wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"
wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"

Notes:
> all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
> 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that w * h * l is zero
> the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20
> FORTH: the number of rolls will be a positive or null integer (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)
*/

/*
P - Three arguments as integers.
R - String representing the number of wallpaper rolls required. Will always be less than 20.
E - 
wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0)    // "ten"
wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0)    // "zero"
P - 
function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
  // If the volume of the room is 0, return "zero".
  // Else, calculate the volume of the room.
  // Add 15% of the needed volume.
  // Divide by a standard size roll with a volume of 5.2 meters.
  // Round up and return integer as a string.
}

const numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve","thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen", "twenty"];

function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
  return l * w * h === 0 ? numbers[0] : numbers[Math.ceil((l * h * 2 + w * h * 2) * 1.15 / 5.2)];
}

// Test: 
// console.log(wallpaper(6.3, 4.5, 3.29))
// console.log(wallpaper(7.8, 2.9, 3.29))
// console.log(wallpaper(6.3, 5.8, 3.13))
// console.log(wallpaper(6.1, 6.7, 2.81))
// console.log(wallpaper(0, 5.6, 3.20))
