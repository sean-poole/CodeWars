/* Tic-Tac-Toe Checker */

/*
If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!

Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", or 2 if it is an "O", like so:
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 0]]

We want our function to return:
-1 if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),
1 if "X" won,
2 if "O" won,
0 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).

You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

/*
P - Array containing three arrays of integers representing a tic-tac-toe board.
R - 0 if the provided game is a tie, 1 if "X" won, 2 if "O" won, -1 if the board is incomplete.
