/* Basic Variable Assignment */

/*
This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?
*/

/*
P - Fix the code to assign strings to variables.
R - String of concatenated string variables.
E - console.log(name)     // "codewa.rs"
P - Use "=" for assignment, instead of comparison operator "==".
let a == "code";
let b == "wa.rs";
let name == a + b;
*/

let a = "code";
let b = "wa.rs";
let name = a + b;

// Test
// console.log(name);
