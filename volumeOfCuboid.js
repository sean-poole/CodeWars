/* Volume of a Cuboid */

/*
Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: the length, width and height of the cuboid. Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.
*/

const volume = (l, w, h) => l * w * h;

// Test: 
console.log(volume(1, 2, 2))
console.log(volume(6, 2, 5))
