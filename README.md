# CodeWars Challenges: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/sp21" target="_blank">Visit Here</a>

A repository of practice problems. I have completed over 100+ challenges and push 7 solutions every week.


## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** Javascript

My morning routine includes solving one problem each day.


## Optimizations:

As I learn more and strengthen my skills, I come back to refactor my code for efficiency and readabliity.


## Lessons Learned: 

Not having the answer to every problem is okay, as long as there is a willingness to find a solution and take the initiative to improve.
