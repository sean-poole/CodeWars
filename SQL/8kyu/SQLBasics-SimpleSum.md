# SQL Basics: Simple Sum

## Task
For this challenge you need to create a simple SUM statement that will sum all the ages.

people table schema
>
> name
> age

select table schema
> age_sum (sum of ages)

NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.
NOTE2: You need to use ALIAS for creating age_sum


## Solution
Select 'age' values from table 'people'.
Apply SUM function to all age values. Store value as 'age_sum'.
Return 'age_sum'.

SELECT SUM(age) AS age_sum
FROM people
