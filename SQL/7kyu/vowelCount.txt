Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

You are given a table 'getcount' with column 'str', return a table with column 'str' and your result in a column named 'res'.



## Get str from the getcount table.
## Remove all instances of vowels from str, calculate the length of the modified str, and subtract from the length of the original str.
## Store calculated result as res.
## Return columns of 'str' with original strings and 'res' with the count of vowels in each string.

SELECT
  str,
  LENGTH(str) - LENGTH(TRANSLATE(str, 'aeiou', '')) AS res
FROM getcount;
